# CG

Computer graphics project  
Day and night mode  
Includes everything from 1 - 9 week from the computer graphics course + face culling (on the models), advanced lighting (applied in shaders whenever any kind of lighting is included) and blending (mode discard used - on the grass texture).  
Group A - cubemaps (enviroment)  
Group B - hdr & bloom (moon/sun glow) 

W, A, S, D for moving around. Use SHIFT to toggle fast movement on or off.  
F1 to toggle ImGui on/off. ImGui gives mouse input + controls.  
M to switch between night and day mode.  
F to toggle flashlight on/off. Flashlight can be used only in night mode.  
SPACE to toggle Bloom on/off
